Raindrops
=========

 

Move the catcher left or right to catch as many raindrops as you can. Every raindrop you catch will increase your score. Every 20 raindrops that you miss, will result in a loss of a life. However, you have a total of 3 lives. Also, every 10 raindrops that you catch, your life can also increase by one. After you have used your 3 lives, the game is over and press "r" on your keyboard to restart the game. 


Glitches: When the game is over, the raindrops are still seen at the top of the screen, somewhat flashing. The vel, and acc was made 0 and the loc of raindrop is -height, but they still seem to appear randomly at the top.
